# s.i.n.w.w.a. (Shit I Never Want to Write Again)

I've written too many damn design systems in my career, and I got to the point where I thought to myself: "omg, if I have to write another one of these, I'm going to punch a marshmallow".

So in order to spare the life of some poor, unsuspecting marshmallow, I made this repo.

I do not claim for this to contain the _best_ way to roll out a design system from scratch, only as a reference for my future self to how I once:

1. Wrote component logic.
2. Designed component prop interfaces & compositions.
3. Chose UI libraries to build off of.

Given how quickly the JS ecosystem moves, I fully expect everything to be obsolete yesterday. But hopefully, this helps serve as a good resource for future me, and maybe one other person (could that be you?).

# Run it Locally

To check out the project locally:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make sure you have some sort of package manager installed. I prefer [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) but [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or any other tool works just as well.
3. Install deps. (`pnpm i` or `yarn install`)
4. Run Storybook. (`pnpm storybook` or `yarn storybook`)
