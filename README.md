# s.i.n.w.w.a. (Shit I Never Want to Write Again)

I've written too many damn design systems in my career, and I got to the point where I thought to myself: "omg, if I have to write another one of these, I'm going to punch a marshmallow".

So, in order to spare the life of some poor unsuspecting marshmallow, I made this repo.

I do not claim for this to contain the _best_ way to roll out a design system from scratch, only as a reference for my future self to how I once:

1. wrote component logic
2. designed component prop interfaces & compositions
3. chose UI libraries to build off of

Given how quickly the JS ecosystem moves, I fully expect everything to be obsolete yesterday. But hopefully, this helps serve as a good resource for future me, and maybe one other person (could that be you?).
